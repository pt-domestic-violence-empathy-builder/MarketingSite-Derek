# MarketingSite-Derek
Repository for the Domestic Violence Marketing website. 


The marketing site for the project contains three pages. 

The first page is the home page where pressing the button in the middle will take you to the front end project, the calculator. It has a navigation bar with drop down menus for the different sections, and a description of the project as well as a link both for the freefrom website and the domestic violence hotline.

The second page is an about us page. Either through the drop down menu or on the page itself you can click on each person's name and read a short description of them and their roles on the team. The middle circle changes to a picture of the person.

The last page is for a contact form. The form is fully functional and contains a name, phone, email, and comment section.

All pages are built responsively from a mobile first approach. LESS was used during the coding.
